Open ends: 50
Non-empty tiles: 49
Difficulty: EXTREME (HIGH RISK OF OUT-OF-MEMORY)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIMULATED RUN (NOT EXECUTED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why not executed:
- This case is nearly fully filled (49/49 non-empty tiles) and contains many CROSS ('+') tiles.
- The search branching factor can be enormous, and A* may keep a very large frontier + visited set.
- This combination can quickly push memory usage to the machine limit (OOM risk).

Expected behavior if executed (hypothetical):
- Status: TIMEOUT / OOM (Out Of Memory) is likely.
- Time: unknown (could be tens of minutes to hours).
- RAM Peak: unknown (could grow until the machine limit and get killed).
- Nodes explored: extremely large (could reach millions+).

Notes:
- This file is a “simulated result” describing the out-of-memory risk of test15.
  It is NOT a measured result from an actual run on the machine.
