TEST CASE: test14_extreme_cross.txt

Open ends: 40
Non-empty tiles: 38
Difficulty: EXTREME (HIGH RISK OF OUT-OF-MEMORY)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SIMULATED RUN (NOT EXECUTED)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why not executed:
- This case contains many CROSS ('+') tiles => very large branching factor.
- A* may need to keep a huge frontier + visited set => memory can grow rapidly and may exceed RAM.

Expected behavior if executed (hypothetical):
- Status: TIMEOUT / OOM (Out Of Memory) is likely.
- Time: unknown (could be tens of minutes to hours).
- RAM Peak: unknown (could grow until the machine limit and get killed).
- Nodes explored: extremely large (could reach hundreds of thousands to millions+).

Notes:
- This file is a “simulated result” describing the out-of-memory risk of test14.
  It is NOT a measured result from an actual run on the machine.
